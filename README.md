## Introduction

This is an OCR app that could read all document and images and extract the texts and their corresponding locations in a json file. This app is helpful for information extraction to digital formats, making them easier to store, search, and manage. This app can support different input file types, such as: ``.png``, ``.heic``, ``.tiff``, ``.pdf``, ``.doc``, ``.docx``.

This app utilizes different tech stacks:
- **Read images/docs**: mimetypes, pillow, pillow-heif, PyMuPDF
- **Preprocess images**: numpy
- **Text detection**: opencv-python
- **Text extraction**: pytesseract
- **Save and store outputs**: os, json
